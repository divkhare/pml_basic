# pml_basic
This function performs Perceptron, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree Learning, Random Forest, and K Nearest Neighbors algorithm on the full Iris data set. It starts with importing the full iris data set followed by assigning petal length , petal width,sepal length and sepal width (4 features) to the variable X and corresponding class labels to y. This data is then split into 30% test data and 70% train data using "train_test_split" function and standardized using "StandardScaler"  class from scikit-learns processing module. All of the above is required to train a model in scikit-learn which is followed by the next step, predictions using the predict method. This is what separates all the different algorithms, scikit.linear_model consists of the defined algorithms that do predictions. Every prediction command is followed by "misclassification samples" to check if the algorithm converged and found a decision boundary.
